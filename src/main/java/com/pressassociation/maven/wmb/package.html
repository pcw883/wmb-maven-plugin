This package contains the classes that make up the Websphere Message Broker (WMB)
Maven plugin. This plugin creates a new Maven package type/lifecycle called 'bar'.
The bar lifecycle covers three Maven lifecycle phases - package, install and deploy.
</p>
<h3>Package</h3>
<p>
The package phase uses the configuration from the POM file to create one or more
invocations of the IBM <b>mqsicreatebar</b> utility. This can be configured three ways:
<ul>
<li>Single - creates a single BAR file containing all specified artifacts and projects.</li>
<li>Individual - creates a BAR file for each specified artifact and the dependent projects.</li>
<li>Barfile - uses a custom 'barfiles' configuration block to generate a custom barfile
containing one or more flows and their dependent projects.</li>
</ul>
This combination of package options allows for maximum flexibility in the way that
message flows are packaged for deployment to the Message Broker.
</p>
<h3>Install</h3>
<p>The install phase generates a POM for all the BAR files it finds in the standard
Maven 'target' directory and installs them into the specified repository.
</p>
<h3>Deploy</h3>
<p>The deploy phase generates one or more invocations of the IBM <b>mqsideploy</b>
utility to deploy the current set of BAR files to the specified Message Broker instance.
</p>
<h4>N.B.</h4>
<p>This package description is created using the deprecated 'package.html' file, rather than the
more modern 'package-info.java'. This is because the Maven plugin compiler currently chokes on
'package-info.java' and breaks the build.</p>
